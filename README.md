Code for glitching audio files in a realisting way. The algorithm for the glitches is basically what you would get if you moved the needle on a record player following the plot of a seismograph. The LFNoise oscillators in the "a" variable generate the plot of this graph, which is then multiplied by a simple linear rate to alter the frames per second of the sample rapidly over periods of microseconds. The "scope" method is called on the result so you can see the algorithm as it works.  Googling to find code to get the effect I wanted got me no where, so this is my original solution. The two files on this repository are included so the curious programmer may choose to connect their own MIDI device for enhanced control over the glitch algorithm, or simply let the algorithm work on its own.

See my other work in Supercollider [here](https://github.com/mnd-dsgn/red_sun). [Supercollider](http://supercollider.github.io/download.html) is a dynamically typed, garbage-collected, single inheritance object-oriented and functional language similar to Smalltalk with syntax similar to Lisp or the C programming language.
